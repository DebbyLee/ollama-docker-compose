This repo contains two Docker Compose file examples that demonstrate how to use Ollama UI and Ollama.

The `docker-compose.yml` in the `ollama-ollamaui` directory is an example of using Ollama UI and Ollama as separate images.

The `docker-compose.yml` in the `ollama-with-ollama-bundle` directory is an example that uses a single container image bundling Open WebUI with Ollama, allowing for a streamlined setup via a single command.
